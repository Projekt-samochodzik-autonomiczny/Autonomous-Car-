Design Assumptions  
1. Project Objective  
The goal of the project is to create a small autonomous vehicle that can move independently, avoid obstacles, and explore its surroundings using a LiDAR sensor.  

2. Technical Specifications  
• Steering system: Front axle with steering controlled by a servo motor  
• Power supply: Li-Ion batteries  
• Drive: Two DC electric motors powering the rear wheels, motor controller  
• Main controller: Microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi)  
• Sensors:  
  o LiDAR for environment scanning  
  o Optional: Camera for image analysis, Encoders for motion control  

3. Features  
• Autonomous navigation: Obstacle avoidance using LiDAR  
• Environment mapping: Creation of a simple map and avoidance of previously detected obstacles  
• Connectivity: Communication via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for monitoring or control  

4. Algorithms and Software  
• LiDAR data processing: Algorithms for filtering and obstacle detection  
• User interface: Optional application for monitoring (e.g., on a smartphone or computer)  

5. Materials and Construction  
• Enclosure: 3D printing or/or lightweight plastics, optionally pre-made chassis available online  
• Electronics assembly: Modular, allowing easy replacement of components  

6. Internet of Things (IoT) and its Implementation  
• Vehicle control: Ability to change operation mode and direction of movement via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth  
• Data recording: Recording of data about the trip, such as travel time, user, and battery usage
